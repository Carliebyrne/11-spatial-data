# Core skills program - week 8 - Process predictions and optimisation over time

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/core-skills/08-time-network-analysis.git/master)

 The aim of today's session will be to ... **todo**: fill this out with aims <!-- generalize the concepts for unidimensional data we learnt about last week to multidimensional data types, including ideas like central tendency, dispersion and correlations. We'll also introduce approaches to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset - that is (a) how we can identify when a dataset can be represented accurately with a smaller number of variables, and (b) how we can identify the variables that contain the most information, with techniques like PCA/PLS, MDS, SOFM and clustering. -->

You should aim to understand ... **todo** fill this out with learning outcomes<!-- the similarities and differences between univariate and multivariate data settings (you'll still need to be able to an EDA on multivatiate data for example). You should also aim to understand the basis of dimensionality reductions, execute measures of correlations, as well as understanding when correlations might be spurious. -->

## Pre-session Reading & Resources

**Todo:** add pre-session reading and resources (and _why_ you might like to read them - see [week two's README](https://github.com/core-skills/02-getting-to-know-the-tools/blob/master/README.md) as an example)
